            <h2>Creating a Replica Map of Rocky Mountain National Park</h2>
            <p>
                When looking for examples of beauty and effectiveness in cartography, the reference maps created by the U.S. National Park Service are hard to top.
                The maps are not only visually appealing, but they are also highly functional and informative.
                As an exercise in cartography (and as a project for modules 4 & 5 of
                <a href="https://gis.ucla.edu/node/59" target="_blank">Cartography - GEOG XL 180 @ UCLA Extension</a>), I decided to create a replica map of
                <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/9r4rNBuFRtuggJBH6" target="_blank">Rocky Mountain National Park</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                A sort of "reproduction" project, I created a hillshade layer for the region using a DEM from the 
                <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/the-national-map-data-delivery" target="_blank">USGS</a>.
                I then added vector details like roads, trails, and water features from various sources like
                <a href="https://romo-nps.opendata.arcgis.com/" target="_blank">the NPS</a>,
                <a href="https://www.codot.gov/programs/gis" target="_blank">Colorado DOT</a>, and
                <a href="https://geo.colorado.edu/">UC Boulder</a>.
                Throughout the process, I tried to mimic the style and symbology of the official NPS map as closely as possible.
                To hone in the details as best as I could, I loaded the basemap from ArcGIS Pro into Adobe Illustrator and finished the map there.
            </p>

                Rocky Mountain National Park features many peaks, rivers, and lakes.
                This made mapping a time-consuming process since all the various labels needed to be honed-in perfectly.
                There aren't many roads, however the trail network is extensive both inside and outside the park.
                Elevation is a key feature of the park, and the map is designed to highlight the park's topography. 
                Elevation figures are included for many of the park's landmarks, as well as almost all of its named peaks.
                Because of the density of the details in the map, there are some inconsistencies with the NPS version. See if you can spot them!
